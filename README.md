# Create a game in Ruby: Smashbro battle

## For the game we created a few classes

1. Player class

- Implements anything that is related to a player: attacks, take_damage, dead?, status

2. Game class

- Implement the game logic: game loop (run method), game_over?, game_end

3. Turn class

- Implement the logic for changing turns and assigning the attacking player and the ennemy player

To run the game, just run main.rb
